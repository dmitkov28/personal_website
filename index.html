    <p>Howdy. My name is Dimitar Mitkov. I am a market researcher based in Sofia, Bulgaria. In my work I analyze consumer sentiments based on what they post on the web. In my free time I play around with data sets, dabble in SEO and web development, read textbooks or go for extremely long walks around the city.</p>
